    abouttext:`Iâ€™m a passionate Software Developer focused on building modern and scalable web applications with JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I love turning ideas into real solutions that make an impact.
Beyond development, Iâ€™m currently exploring cybersecurity, sharpening my skills to better understand how technology can be built, secured, and protected. My long-term goal is to combine both development and security to create innovative and safe digital experiences.
When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m learning, experimenting, and pushing myself to grow as a developer and as an upcoming cybersecurity expert. ðŸš€`,
